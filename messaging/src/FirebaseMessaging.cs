/// Firebase Cloud Messaging allows you to send data from your server to your
/// users' devices, and receive messages from devices on the same connection
/// if you're using a XMPP server.
///
/// The FCM service handles all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery
/// to client applications running on target devices.

  /// Cloud Messaging.
  ///
  /// This token is what identifies the user to Firebase, so disabling this
  /// avoids creating any new identity and automatically sending it to Firebase,
  /// unless consent has been granted.
  ///
  /// If this setting is enabled, it triggers the token registration refresh
  /// immediately. This setting is persisted across app restarts and overrides
  /// the setting "firebase_messaging_auto_init_enabled" specified in your
  /// Android manifest (on Android) or Info.plist (on iOS and tvOS).
  ///
  /// <p>By default, token registration during initialization is enabled.
  ///
  /// The registration happens before you can programmatically disable it, so
  /// if you need to change the default, (for example, because you want to
  /// prompt the user before FCM generates/refreshes a registration token on app
  /// startup), add to your applicationâ€™s manifest:
  ///
