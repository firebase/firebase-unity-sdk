# CMake file for the Vertex AI in Firebase library

# Vertex AI in Firebase is different from the other Firebase libraries,
# as instead of prebuilding, we provide it as a source library.

# Package every file under src, including subfolders, since we want them all.

# For documentation, get only the C# files at the top level,
