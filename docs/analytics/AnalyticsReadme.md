Get Started with Google Analytics for Firebase
==============================================

Thank you for installing the Unity Google Analytics for Firebase SDK. The
[Analytics guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/unity/start)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

[Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics/)
collects usage and behavior data for your game.

The SDK logs two primary types of information:
* *Events*. What is happening in your game, such as user actions, system events,
  or errors.
* *User properties*. Attributes you define to describe segments of your user
  base, such as language preference or geographic location.

Google Analytics automatically logs some events and user properties; you don't
need to add any code to enable them. If your app needs to collect additional
data, you can set up to 25 different Analytics user properties and log up to
500 different Analytics event types in your app. There is no limit on the total
volume of events your app logs.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Analytics` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Analytics/readme.md`.

# Demos

[Mecha Hamster](https://github.com/google/mechahamster) is provided as a demo
which showcases the integration of multiple Firebase features within a single
game.  The source is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/mechahamster), and the live application
is available for iOS on the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mechahamster/id1286046770?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
