Get Started with Firebase Dynamic Links
========================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase Dynamic Links Unity SDK. The
[Dynamic Links guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/unity/create)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

You can use
[Firebase Dynamic Links](https://firebase.google.com/products/dynamic-links/)
to create short or long Dynamic Links. The API takes several optional parameter
structures to build links. Short links can also be created from a previously
generated long link. The Dynamic Links API will generate a URL like
https://example.page.link/aSDf.


# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/DynamicLinks` directory. To configure and run the
sample, follow the instructions in
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/DynamicLinks/readme.md`.

# Demos

game.  The source is available on
