Get Started with Firebase Realtime Database
===========================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase Realtime Database Unity SDK. The
[Realtime Database guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/unity/start)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

[Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/)
stores and synchronizes data with our NoSQL cloud database. Data is synced
across all clients in real time, and remains available when your app goes
offline.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Database` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Database/Storage/readme.md`.

# Demos

[Mecha Hamster](https://github.com/google/mechahamster) is provided as a demo
which showcases the integration of multiple Firebase features within a single
game.  The source is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/mechahamster), and the live application
is available for iOS on the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mechahamster/id1286046770?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
