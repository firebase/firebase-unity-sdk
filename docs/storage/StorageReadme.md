Get Started with Cloud Storage for Firebase
===========================================

Thank you for installing the Unity Cloud Storage for Firebase SDK. The
[Cloud Storage guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/unity/start)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

[Cloud Storage for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage/),
lets you upload and share user generated content, such as images and video,
which allows you to build rich media content into your apps. Your data is
stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, an exabyte scale object storage
solution with high availability and global redundancy. Cloud Storage lets you
securely upload these files directly from mobile devices and web browsers,
handling spotty networks with ease.

### Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Storage` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Storage/readme.md`.

### Demos

[Mecha Hamster](https://github.com/google/mechahamster) is provided as a demo
which showcases the integration of multiple Firebase features within a single
game.  The source is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/mechahamster), and the live application
is available for iOS on the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mechahamster/id1286046770?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
