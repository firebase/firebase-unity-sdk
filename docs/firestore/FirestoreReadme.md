Get Started with Cloud Firestore for Firebase
=============================================

Thank you for installing the Unity Cloud Firestore for Firebase SDK. The
[Firestore guide](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

You can use
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)
to store and sync data for client- and server-side development.

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and
server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. Like Firebase
Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through
realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can
build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet
connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other
Firebase and Google Cloud Platform products, including Cloud Functions.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Firestore` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Firestore/readme.md`.

# Demos

[Mecha Hamster](https://github.com/google/mechahamster) is provided as a demo
which showcases the integration of multiple Firebase features within a single
game.  The source is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/mechahamster), and the live application
is available for iOS on the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mechahamster/id1286046770?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
and for Android on the
(Google Play Store)[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.fpl.mechahamster&hl=en].
