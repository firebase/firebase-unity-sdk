Get Started with Firebase Cloud Messaging
=========================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase Cloud Messaging Unity SDK. The
[Cloud Messaging guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/unity/client)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

You can use
[Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/)
to push notifications and data messages to iOS and Android clients.
The [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) provides an
interface for sending notifications to devices via a range of targeting
parameters like audiences defined in Google Analytics.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Messaging` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Messaging/readme.md`.
