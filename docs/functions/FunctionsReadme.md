Get Started with Cloud Functions for Firebase 
=============================================

Thank you for installing the Cloud Functions for Firebase Unity SDK. The
[Cloud Functions guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

You can use
[Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions/)
to you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by
Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your code is stored in Google's cloud
and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own
servers.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/Functions` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Functions/readme.md`.

# Demos
