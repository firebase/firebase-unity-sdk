Get Started with Firebase App Check
===================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase App Check Unity SDK. App Check
is intended to be used in conjunction with other Firebase products:

* [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/)
* [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions/)
* [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/)
* [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/)

# Overview

[Firebase App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/)
helps protect your API resources from abuse by preventing unauthorized clients
from accessing your backend resources. It works with both Firebase services,
Google Cloud services, and your own APIs to keep your resources safe.
