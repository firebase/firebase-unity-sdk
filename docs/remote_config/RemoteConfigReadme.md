Get Started with Firebase Remote Config
=======================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase Remote Config Unity SDK. The
[Remote Config guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/use-config-unity)
provides instructions to configure a Unity project.

# Overview

You can use
[Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/)
to define parameters in your app and update their values in the cloud, allowing
you to modify the appearance and behavior of your app without distributing an
app update. The Remote Config library is used to store in-app default parameter
values, fetch updated parameter values from the service, and control when
fetched values are made available to your app.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig` directory. To configure and run the
sample, follow the instructions in
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig/readme.md`.

# Demos

[Mecha Hamster](https://github.com/google/mechahamster) is provided as a demo
which showcases the integration of multiple Firebase features within a single
game.  The source is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/google/mechahamster), and the live application
is available for iOS on the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mechahamster/id1286046770?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
and for Android on the
