## How to upgrade supported unity versions
**Background**

This GitHub Action leverages [U3D](github.com/DragonBox/u3d), which is a command line tool for working with Unity from the command line on all three operating systems. 

In this GitHub Action, supported Unity Versions are maintained by `UNITY_SETTINGS` in `gha/unity/unity_installer.py`. 

**Add a new Unity version support**

1. Install [U3D](github.com/DragonBox/u3d).

2. Generate new JSON string and added it to `UNITY_SETTINGS`:
  -   `Major_version_number`: unity major version number: 2020, 2021, etc.
  -   `Full_version_number`: unity full version number. e.g. 2020.3.34f1 for major version 2020. Run `u3d available` and select [Unity LTS versions](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).
  -   `Platform`: Values of [Android,iOS,tvOS,Windows,macOS,Linux]
  -   `Package`:[Unity Hub must **not** been installed] Unity Packages that required for certain platform. e.g. ["Windows-mono"] pakcages for "Windows" platform. To list avaliable packages, run `u3d available -u $unity_version -p`.

      ```
      UNITY_SETTINGS = {
        Major_version_number: {
          OS: {
            "version": Full_version_number,
            "packages": {Platform: [Package], ...},
          },
          ...
        },
      }
      ```

**Common failures & solutions**

1. If you met problem with `u3d` cmd (e.g. `u3d available -u $unity_version -p`), please install older version of `u3d` and disable the `u3d` version check. Then try it again.
    ```
    gem install u3d -v 1.2.3
    export U3D_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1
    ``` 

2. If you have problem with Android build. Make sure you are using the right version of NDK and JDK. Testapp building process is using a patch function `patch_android_env` in `build_testapp.py`. (Please refer [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html) for Android environment setup).
