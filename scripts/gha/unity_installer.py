r"""Utility for downloading, installing and licensing Unity in CI.

Uses u3d for downloading and installing Unity, which must first be installed.
Can be installed as a gem:

gem install u3d

See https://github.com/DragonBox/u3d for details on u3d.

USAGE
Using Unity on CI requires the following flow:
(1) Install Unity
(2) Activate Unity License
(*) Use Unity
(3) Release Unity License

This tool supports (1), (2) and (3).


(1) Installation:
  unity_installer.py --install --version 2017.3.1f1 --platforms Android,iOS

'platforms' specifies additional build supports to install. Always installs
Unity itself.

u3d will install Unity to the following path. The full path to the binary is
listed, as that's needed to use Unity in batchmode.

Windows: C:/Program Files/Unity_{version}/editor/unity.exe
MacOS: /Applications/Unity_{version}/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity


(2) License activation:
  unity_installer.py --activate_license --version 2017.3.1f1 \
    --license_file ~/license.txt --logfile activate.log

  or:
  unity_installer.py --activate_license --version 2017.3.1f1 \
    --username username --password password --serial_ids serial_ids \
    --logfile activate.log

This will invoke the given version of Unity, passing in the license information
from --license_file to activate Unity. The license file should be structured
as follows:
The first line is the username for a Unity account.
The second line is the password for that Unity account.
Each subsequent line is a serial ID.

Example:
username@google.com
dhuew89IDhdeuwjd98dA
X4-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX


(3) License release:
  unity_installer.py --release_license --version 2017.3.1f1 --logfile return.log

# Implementation note: it would have been simpler to pass a
# string directly to u3d. The issue is that there's a relationship between
# the value of this flag, and the --platforms flag in build_testapps.py.
# e.g. if we want to pass "Android,Desktop,iOS" to build_testapps.py, then we
# need to pass "Unity,Android,Ios" to U3D.
# In a CI context, where platforms may be parameterized, some logic would be
# needed to pass the appropriately formatted values to both tools.
# Instead, this tool is written to expect the same format as build_testapps.py.
# This keeps the CI workflow logic simple, but requires some parsing of the
