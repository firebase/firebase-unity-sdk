  /// handling into the Firestore data model representation. Deserialization works the same way: first the Firestore
  /// data model representation is converted into .NET types in the default manner for this library, and the result is
  /// passed to the converter. Note that this means there can be asymmetry between serialization and deserialization: if the
  /// <see cref="M:FirestoreConverter`1{T}.ToFirestore(T)"/> method returns an <see cref="Int32"/>, deserializing the result will involve
  /// the <see cref="FromFirestore(object)"/> method receiving an <see cref="Int64"/> value as that's the default
